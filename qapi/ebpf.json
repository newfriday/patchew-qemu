# @request-ebpf:
#
# Returns eBPF object that can be loaded with libbpf.
# Management applications (g.e. libvirt) may load it and pass file
# descriptors to QEMU. Which allows running QEMU without BPF capabilities.
# It's crucial that eBPF program/map is compatible with QEMU, so it's
# provided through QMP.
#
# Returns: RSS eBPF object encoded in base64.
#
# Since: 8.3
