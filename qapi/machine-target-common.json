# @CpuModelInfo:
#
# Virtual CPU model.
#
# A CPU model consists of the name of a CPU definition, to which
# delta changes are applied (e.g. features added/removed). Most magic values
# that an architecture might require should be hidden behind the name.
# However, if required, architectures can expose relevant properties.
#
# @name: the name of the CPU definition the model is based on
# @props: a dictionary of QOM properties to be applied
#
# Since: 2.8

##
# @CpuModelExpansionType:
#
# An enumeration of CPU model expansion types.
#
# @static: Expand to a static CPU model, a combination of a static base
#          model name and property delta changes. As the static base model will
#          never change, the expanded CPU model will be the same, independent of
#          QEMU version, machine type, machine options, and accelerator options.
#          Therefore, the resulting model can be used by tooling without having
#          to specify a compatibility machine - e.g. when displaying the "host"
#          model. The @static CPU models are migration-safe.

# @full: Expand all properties. The produced model is not guaranteed to be
#        migration-safe, but allows tooling to get an insight and work with
#        model details.
#
# Note: When a non-migration-safe CPU model is expanded in static mode, some
#       features enabled by the CPU model may be omitted, because they can't be
#       implemented by a static CPU model definition (e.g. cache info passthrough and
#       PMU passthrough in x86). If you need an accurate representation of the
#       features enabled by a non-migration-safe CPU model, use @full. If you need a
#       static representation that will keep ABI compatibility even when changing QEMU
#       version or machine-type, use @static (but keep in mind that some features may
#       be omitted).

##
# @CpuModelCompareResult:
#
# An enumeration of CPU model comparison results. The result is usually
# calculated using e.g. CPU features or CPU generations.
#
# @incompatible: If model A is incompatible to model B, model A is not
#                guaranteed to run where model B runs and the other way around.
#
# @identical: If model A is identical to model B, model A is guaranteed to run
#             where model B runs and the other way around.
#
# @superset: If model A is a superset of model B, model B is guaranteed to run
#            where model A runs. There are no guarantees about the other way.
#
# @subset: If model A is a subset of model B, model A is guaranteed to run
#          where model B runs. There are no guarantees about the other way.
