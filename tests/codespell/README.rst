=============================
Check spelling with codespell
=============================

`make check-spelling` can be used to get a list of spelling errors.
It reports files with spelling errors and a summary of all misspelled words.
The report is generated by the latest version of codespell, a spell checker
implemented in Python.

See https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell for more information.

Some file patterns are excluded from the check.

In addition tests/codespell includes several files which are used to
suppress certain false positives in the codespell report.

exclude-file - complete lines which should be ignored
ignore-words - list of words which should be ignored
